This Python project provides a Scientific Calculator and Unit Converter using the Tkinter library for a user-friendly interface. The main menu allows users to choose between the calculator and unit converters for temperature or length.


# Scientific Calculator: 
Supports basic arithmetic, advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and constants (Pi, Euler's number). It includes features for clearing input and evaluating expressions, with error handling for invalid operations.   

# Unit Converter 
## Temperature Converter:
Converts between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin using conversion functions and updates the results dynamically.

## Length Converter:
Converts between units such as meters, kilometers, miles, and inches, using a dictionary of conversion factors.
